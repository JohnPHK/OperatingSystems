How to run the program: python3 part1.py addr-simpleloop.ref 

addr-simpleloop.ref: Instruction "0x0108000" page is access the most. The loop counter has to increment every iterations on the heap/stack, 
which require read and write update. Moreover there are 10000 iterations, therefore we predict the loop counter is stored at this page.

Counts:
  Instructions  120406
  Loads         50090
  Stores        10063
  Modifies      10006


addr-matmul.ref: Instruction "0x0108000" page is access the most. Matrix C has to be initialize and sum by matrix a, b in every single iterations, 
which requires a read and addition follow by a write acess. We believed the loop counter and result Matrix C arrays are stored on these pages.

Counts:
  Instructions  47473963
  Loads         21491394
  Stores        1180752

addr-blocked.ref: Instruction page "0x0109000" is access the most. There are a lot of inner loops in the program. The most inner loop's 
counter will be access the most, which requires a read, then addtion and multiplication. In the end, the values has to be stored back in 
array of struct C. We believed the loop counter and result struct C arrays are stored on these pages.

Counts:
  Instructions  51791748
  Loads         21578983
  Stores        1283021
  Modifies      1091709
